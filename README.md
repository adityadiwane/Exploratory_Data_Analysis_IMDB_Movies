# Exploratory Data Analysis of IMDB Movies Data-set

In this project I have conducted Exploratory Data Analysis of the IMDB 5000 Movies Data-set hosted on Kaggle. 
I have used R language as the vehicle to carry out the analysis and used github pages to present the analysis on a static webpage created using R Markdown.
